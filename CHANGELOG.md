# Change Log

## v5.0.1

### Fixed

- Package.json now contains a `main` and fixes #89 ([@andreclemente](https://github.com/andreclemente))

## v5.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- Remove support for Vue 2
  - If you need to continue supporting Vue2 please switch to the [vue2-debounce](https://github.com/dhershman1/vue2-debounce) package or stay of v4 of this one
- vue-debounce is now registered as a ES `module` instead of a cjs package
  - This helps the transition over to Vue3
  - This will help keep the typing system clean

### Fixed

- README now reflects how to use vue-debounce with only vue3

## v4.0.1

### Improved

- Added PR #79 for export support
- Added PR #82 for fixed typings

### Chores

- Dependency updates

## v4.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `getDirective` flow there is now a dedicated import for vue 2, and vue 3

### Improved

- Made usage easier, instead of trying to support complex backwards compatability, I simply separated the two into their own imports
- Usage should be less convoluted

### Fixed

- Vue 3 compatability should be stabalized and working again

## v3.1.1

### Fixed

- Erroring out when there were no attributes on your element tag [#71](https://github.com/dhershman1/vue-debounce/issues/71)
- Potential issue if passed events was just an empty array or string would cause debounce to stop listening all together
  - This falls back on the value of `listenTo`

## v3.1.0

### Improved

- Now using vNode instead of raw events, this allows us to use events no matter how deep [#66](https://github.com/dhershman1/vue-debounce/issues/66)
  - The above improves compatability with libraries like Vuetify

### Chore

- Dependency Updates and Audit fixes

## v3.0.2

### New

- The build will now push out a esm module as well with the other minified versions check the readme on how to use it

### Chores

- Updated dependencies
- Ran Audit on dev deps (and fixed)

### Fixed

- Some documentation mis communications

## v3.0.1

### Improved

- Types for debounce (thanks to [hrobertson](https://github.com/hrobertson))
- Placement of the readme for `getDirective`

## v3.0.0

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Lots of code condencing, shouldn't break anything but just in case
- Changed how debouncing `fireonempty` works. It had a bug so I made it a bit more strict to fix this
  - Please open issues ASAP if this functionality is not working as expected

### New

- Added new `trim` option and modifier, this allows you to trim inputs that come through
  - The value given to your function will **NOT** be the trimmed value, trim is only used for logic to see if things should be ran
- Added `getDirective` function which allows you to create a directive instance at lower levels other than global

### Improved

- Some small code cleanup
- Updated dependencies

## v2.6.0

### New

- Added Vue 3 Compatibility :tada:
